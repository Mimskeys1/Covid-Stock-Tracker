The Prototype allows for the operation of the site. Most of the functionality is complete the only parts that are missing are as follows. 
 - Database of live data That would be needed for calculation
 - Adding the remainder of different stocks to choose. (only have 5 stocks with preset returns)
 - changing weekly reinvestments to other settings (daily, weekly, annually)
 - correction of the message after calculation is made as not working correctly.
The website allows you to make an investment with 1 or 5 stocks and compare between them and the S&P Historical average.
This is proof of concept as the stock percentages are manufactured.
