Concept description
This project revolves around the idea of a Basic reinvestment calculator. From that idea I would like to allow the user to have access to choose to decide which stock on the SPY that they would like to reinvest the money into. The calculator would then show how much capital was invested in, the money at the earned and the historic percentage gain. I would also like this to be shown on a line graph showing both figures.
